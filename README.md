## How Does It Work?

A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 is a web-based dashboard. You can login and access it from any computer or device.

A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 utilizes the hottest AI technology that you've probably heard about, and might already be using: ChatGPT/OpenAI.

I've seen a few AI software offers lately in the "internet marketing" and "bizop" space that claim to have created something better than ChaptGPT. To that I say: yeah, right, good luck with that!

Of course OpenAI isn't the only player in the game. There are several incredible AI engines out there doing amazing things. Who knows which ones will emerge in the coming decades. BUT... I don't believe any small-time business or solo entrepreneur who claims they "suddenly" came up with a better engine or language model than GPT.

The top AI models that you're seeing now have been years in the making.
So we tapped into the hottest technology by using their API on the backend. It uses your own OpenAI account (which can be opened for free). If you've ever used ChatGPT, then you already have an account. All you need to do is grab your API key, which is VERY easy to do and we'll show you exactly how to do it.

In case you're a current user of our GPTDash platform, the A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 is built within that same platform, but it consists of different tools and is a seperate membership module.

## AI Children's Book Maker 2500 OTO - Detailed Features:

Here's what A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 will do for you. When you log into the dashboard, you'll have four options, or "routes" to choose from...

## AI Children's Book Maker 2500 OTO - Benefits:

- In case you were wondering, there are MANY ways to make money with children's books. Here are several ways to monetize this hot opportunity starting today:

Most people think about "traditional publishing" methods when they think about authoring children's books. That's certainly one option. You can submit your books to publishers or literary agents, and if you're lucky, you might get your book accepted, in which case you could receive an advance and royalties. However, there are SO MANY MORE opportunities these days, and you don't have to get "lucky" to use them. In fact, in recent years many successful children's book authors are reporting that they're able to make a LOT MORE MONEY by not going the "traditional" route.

## Here are just some of your options for making money with the children's books you create...

## Self-publishing:

This is the route that many of the most successful and highly paid authors are using today. You can publish your book independently through platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) or IngramSpark. With this option, you get to keep a MUCH larger share of your profits compared to a traditional book publisher. This option can also utilize both printed books, and digital ebooks.

While royalties in traditional publishing are usually in the 5%-15% range, authors who choose self-publishing often earn as much as 70% or more!

## Print on demand (POD):

You can use POD services like Amazon KDP Print or Lulu to print your book on demand. This is a great option if you want to sell your book as a printed physical book, but don't want to spend a lot of money having a big batch printed. In past times, it required a big investment to see your book in print. Today, you can order as few as one copy, and customers can order them on-demand without you ever keeping any inventory!

It's a great hands-free business model. You can spend your time having fun and creating more books, and not worry about printing or fulfilling orders. In the old days, you would have a garage full of books. Today, Print on Demand is a better option.

## Ebooks:

My wife is an avid reader of books, finishing several every month. She likes to feel a book in her hands, so she was a late adopter of ebook technology, but I recently got her an Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, and she loves it. She can bring unlimited books with her everywhere she goes, and to sweeten the deal it's waterproof, so she can read anywhere!

With ebooks being one of the most popular ways books are distributed, it means you can sell digital versions of your book through online retailers like Amazon, Apple iBooks, and Barnes & Noble.

Of course you can also sell ebooks from your own website. It's as simple as saving it as a PDF file so your customers can download it. I have literally sold millions of dollars of ebooks from my own websites over the years.

## Audiobooks:

As if my wife doesn't already consume enough books, she also subscribes to audiobooks, so she can absorb them while she's out running or driving. You can easily create and sell audiobook versions of your children's book on platforms like Audible, iTunes, or Google Play.

You might be thinking, what about the pictures? Trust me, parents still buy them. My wife plays children's books for our youngest one while in the car.

## Licensing and merchandising:

If you walk through the toy section of a department store, you'll notice that a lot of the toys are inspired directly from children's books. You can license your book or characters for use in products like toys, clothing, or games. Perhaps better yet, you create and sell your OWN merchandise featuring your book's characters or artwork.

Sounds difficult? It's really not. Back in the old days, you'd have to figure out a manufacturing deal and invest a bunch of money up-front. Just like Print on Demand for books, there are many Print on Demand sites for ALL kinds of merchandise ranging from mugs, to calendars, to clothing. Some of them include Zazzle, Redbubble, Cafepress, Teespring, Printful, and a TON of others! All you have to do is set up your account and upload your artwork with no upfront cost.

A small example... In 2012 I uploaded a picture to Zazzle of a small painting I did of a Christmas tree, and I've been earning royalties on it every year since, especially around Christmas time. Just last year, someone ordered 150 greeting cards of it.

## Other languages:

You can translate and publish your book in any language. You could also license the rights to your book for translation and distribution in other countries, earning royalties from international sales. How many countries and languages can you think of? Yes, all of those people need children's books!

## Public speaking and workshops:

As a children's book author, you can offer presentations, workshops, or classes related to children's literature or the themes of your book at schools, libraries, and literary events. Sounds FUN, right? Maybe it's not for everyone, but I think it sounds fun. You can also use your children's book as an "in" to gain credibility and trust for your other businesses and niches.

## Grants and awards:

There are many grants, fellowships, and awards that support children's authors and illustrators. In other words, there is FREE MONEY that is available because there are a lot of organizations out there who believe children's literature is an important part of our society. By grabbing the A.I. Children's Book Maker, you can quickly establish yourself as a children's book author and start applying for these grants and awards.

## Patreon or crowdfunding:

Raise funds for your project and/or build a community of supporters through platforms like Patreon, Kickstarter, or Indiegogo. Using crowdfunding, you can turn your book into a best-seller before you even launch it. And using a fan subsciption service like Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee is a way to turn this into a recurring monthly income to keep creating content (such as children's books).

## Freelance writing and illustration:

When you grab the A.I. Children's Book Maker today, we'll include Agency Rights, which means you can use it to create projects for clients. You can offer your writing and illustration services to other authors, publishers, or companies in any niche. These kind of projects can pay big bucks, and you can find gigs on sites like Freelancer, Upwork, and Fiverr. I also think there is a relatively untapped market right now for customized children's books. Think about it... you could create a unique children's book for a client, in which their own child is a character! That's a service that could command a serious payday.

## AI Children's Book Maker 2500 OTO - Frequently Asked Questions:

- What exactly is the A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500?

First, we encourage you to go watch the demo videos above on this page. Then you'll understand exactly what it is. To answer the question, it is a web-based dashboard application. You can login and access it from any computer or device. It enables you to create all the components of a children's book and put them together into a finished product (either an ebook or a print-ready book).

- Why do I need the A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 in addition to ChatGPT?

Our dashboard is designed to enable you to get the most out of the ChatGPT engine, while saving you even more time and achieving even better results. Instead of coming up with prompts for everything, you will simply fill in some blanks in our dashboard, and our programming logic behind the scenes will interface with the AI engines to get the best results for you. Beyond that, we have created a step-by-step process with detailed instructions and tutorials. This is about SO much more than prompts. It took us a lot of trial and error to develop this method and turn it into a system that you can replicate again and again. We're talking about literally thousands of hours of development, plus you get to benefit from everything we learned from our customers of the first version creating thousands of books, and all the things we improved based on their experiences.

- Is it easy to use?

Yes. That's the whole point of it. We designed it so that anyone can use it, even if you have no experience with AI or even with creating content. All you have to do is fill in blanks and click the button.

- Do I need to install this, and will it work on Mac and PC?

You do not need to install anything, as it is web based. Just log in from any computer, including any Apple Mac or Windows PC.

- Are there any upsells?

We offer an upgrade to the Pro edition, which will be shown to you after completing your checkout from this page. It is not available publicly, and we're only offering it to those who grab the Commercial license from us on this page. It includes some great features, like the ability to generate full-length chapter books for older kids and youth. It also comes with several advanced illustration tools that open up more possibilities. The price is affordable, and we'll give you the details on the upgrade page, so you can make an educated decision for your business. And be rest-assured, the Commercial edition you're getting from this page is FULLY functional and will do everything you see on this page and in the demo videos. It's not like it's "missing" anything.

- What is the Commercial License that I'm getting from this page?

The Commercial License membership means you can use the A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 for both personal and business purposes. You can use it for personal projects, business projects, and client projects. It also includes an Agency License, which is what allows you to use it for clients. You can get paid by clients for work that is done using the A.I. Children's Book Maker. You may not share or give your A.I. Children's Book Maker login to your clients, but you wouldn't want to do that anyway because then they would know your secret weapon ;-)

- Can I find this for sale anywhere else?

NO. Sadly, scammers have copied our sales page and marketing materials and are trying to imitate us. They even use pictures of Eric and his family, which is pretty low, don't you think? They've conned a lot of people into buying the software through their site, and then deliver nothing. Or they deliver the shared login credentials of one account, which always gets banned by us immediately. Some of the domains used by these SCAMMERS include WickedApps.com, childrensbookmaker.net, Zooreviews.net, IMtools.com, PLRmadness.net, Genuinebusinessdeals.com, Artificialintelligencegeek.com, Afftoolhub.com, Newrich.com, newrichapps.com, Hugeconversions.net, Traffictrainingzone.com. They use hundreds of names such as Newrich network, Andrew Hunter, Michael Travis, Steven Ramirez, Chris Jones, Larry Pace, Shaun Archer, Alex Wilson, and they are constantly coming up with new names. They also send out SPAM impersonating our names and brand names including AI Children's Book Maker and GPTDash. What they are doing is 100% illegal. They have cost us and our customers tens of thousands of dollars, and we believe these scammers will eventually be brought to justice.

- Will my illustrations or books have any watermarks or branding on them?

No. We added watermarks to a bunch of the illustrations on this page just to make it a little more difficult for the scammers who keep ripping off our sales page. Yours will not have any such thing.

- Are there any additional costs from OpenAI/ChatGPT?

As mentioned in the sales letter above, A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 uses an API key from your own OpenAI account, which can be opened for free. If you've ever used ChatGPT, then you already have an account and you can grab your API key. We show you exactly where and how; it's SUPER EASY even if you have no experience! 

It costs an average of about $0.001 for each use of a writing tool on A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500. That means on average it would cost about $1 for 1000 uses of A.I. Children's Book Maker, with the exception of images. Currently OpenAI's price for large images are about $0.02 (2 cents) each.

In other words, even after your free trial, it will be ridiculously cheap and cost mere pennies to generate children's books with A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500. Note - You do NOT have to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus. The API access is separate, and it is pay-as-you-go so you literally only pay for what you use.

Not sure about signing up? We are also including 100 GPTDash credits on our own API so you can login and try our dashboard immediately just to see how it works! That's enough to run about 100 writing tasks. See? Now you've really got no excuse not to try it. If you are in a restricted country or for some reason are unable to get your own OpenAI API key, we do have an option to pay to use ours. If you're in that situation, just contact us after signing up :-)

- Do you have a money-back guarantee?

Yes, we have a 30 day money-back guarantee. We're confident that you're going to love A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500, but if for any reason you're unhappy with it, you can easily request a full refund within 30 days.

- What's different from the first version of A.I. Children's Book Maker?

So much! The A.I. technology has continued to grow by leaps and bounds, and as a result we have spent thousands of hours integrating the newest technologies. The story-generation capabilities are much improved. The illustration capabilites are vastly improved, and we now have the ability to create consistent characters. We've added a built-in project library, and much more. We also made new tutorials that are truly "master class" level training that will take you through the entire process from "idea" all the way through publishing your book on Amazon. When we say the 2500 version is 100X more powerful than the first version, we really mean it. Yes the "100X" is an arbitrary estimate, but we feel it's a conservative estimate based on the real capabilities and improvements in the software.

- Who are the people behind A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500?

We are Eric Holmlund and Ryan Greene. Eric has been doing business online since 1999, full time since 2003. He has taught thousands of others how to build their online businesses. Also a writer and artist, he has infused his expertise into A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500. Ryan has spent his career in software development and law enforcement. He has been doing business online since 2015, in which he also coaches and trains others to make money online. He has infused a lifetime of technology-related expertise into A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500.

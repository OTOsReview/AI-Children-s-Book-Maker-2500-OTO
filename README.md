## How Does It Work?

A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 is a web-based dashboard. You can login and access it from any computer or device.

A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 utilizes the hottest AI technology that you've probably heard about, and might already be using: ChatGPT/OpenAI.

I've seen a few AI software offers lately in the "internet marketing" and "bizop" space that claim to have created something better than ChaptGPT. To that I say: yeah, right, good luck with that!

Of course OpenAI isn't the only player in the game. There are several incredible AI engines out there doing amazing things. Who knows which ones will emerge in the coming decades. BUT... I don't believe any small-time business or solo entrepreneur who claims they "suddenly" came up with a better engine or language model than GPT.

The top AI models that you're seeing now have been years in the making.
So we tapped into the hottest technology by using their API on the backend. It uses your own OpenAI account (which can be opened for free). If you've ever used ChatGPT, then you already have an account. All you need to do is grab your API key, which is VERY easy to do and we'll show you exactly how to do it.

In case you're a current user of our GPTDash platform, the A.I. Children's Book Maker 2500 is built within that same platform, but it consists of different tools and is a seperate membership module.
